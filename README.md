# XTarget eXtended

Provides a more readable interface for the XTarget window.


Actors are used to determine slow/mezzed state of mobs you are not targeting.  It is not perfect, but it is better than nothing.


â€‹Clicking anywhere on a row will target that target


Right clicking on a row opens a context menu with options for how that xtarget # should behave.  This context menu also has a selection to open settings, and to exit the script.


HP and Aggro% rows can be displayed as bars.


Most colors and threshold values for colors can be changed as you see fit.
